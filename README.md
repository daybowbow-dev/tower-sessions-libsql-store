# tower-sessions-libsql-store

A small library for using [tower-sessions](https://github.com/maxcountryman/tower-sessions) with [libsql](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql).

libSQL is a fork of SQLite, that is accessible over network requests. Ideally I would love to use [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), though that is not possible due to a [current lack of support](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/2674).

## Usage

See [`/examples`]('./examples') folder.
